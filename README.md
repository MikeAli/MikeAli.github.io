# The next pizza night is: Friday, MONTH, DAY, any time after 6 pm ET.
I've got enough dough for 6-medium pizzas.

## Toppings?
If you have something special you want to do bring it or request it ahead of time. Otherwise I'll try to have a few beyond just cheese. 

## RSVP?
Up to you. Just don't surprise me at like 1 am unless you bring whiskey.

## Sides and drinks? 
Bring your own. I'm just making pizza's. There's a garden hose outside for water. I also have some liquor and beer/seltzers.

## Bringing Kids?
That's fine. Just let me know ahead of time if you don't mind in case we need to hide non-kid-friendly shit.

## Want to play video games while you're here?
Let me know what suits your fancy and I'll hook it up: [List of Games](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/94b02eff-9149-449e-9dee-b54ea2af3a3c).
